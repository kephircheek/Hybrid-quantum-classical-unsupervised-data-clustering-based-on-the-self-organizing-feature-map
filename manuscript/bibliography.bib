 abstract = {Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are ubiquitous endogenous RNA found in various organisms that can regulate gene expression in eukaryotes. However, little is known about potential roles for circRNAs in muscle development. We analyzed circRNA sequencing data of bovine skeletal muscle tissue and found differential expression of circTitin (circTTN) in fetal and adult bovine muscle tissue. We then further studied the role of circTTN in bovine muscle development. Overexpression and inhibition of circTTN together elicited its promoting roles in proliferation and differentiation of bovine primary myoblasts. Mechanistically, circTTN showed interaction with miR-432 by luciferase screening and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays. Additionally, miR-432 is a regulator of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), as indicated by luciferase activity, quantitative real-time PCR, and western blotting assays. Increased miR-432 expression inhibited the expression of IGF2, but this effect was remitted by circTTN. Conclusively, our results showed that circTTN promoted proliferation and differentiation of bovine primary myoblasts via competitively combining with miR-432 to activate the IGF2/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway.},

 abstract = {Eimeria tenella, an obligate intracellular parasite, can actively invade the cecal epithelial cells of chickens and cause severe enteric disease. Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) plays a major role in protein synthesis and cell survival. This study aims to explore the exact mechanisms underlying diclazuril inhibition in second-generation merozoites of E. tenella. The eEF2 cDNA of the second-generation merozoites of E. tenella (EtEF2) was cloned by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Diclazuril-induced expression profiles of EtEF2 were also analyzed. The cloned full-length cDNA (2893 bp) of the EtEF2 nucleotide sequence encompassed a 2499 bp open reading frame (ORF) that encoded a polypeptide of 832 residues with an estimated molecular mass of 93.12 kDa and a theoretical isoelectric point of 5.99. The EtEF2 nucleotide sequence was submitted to the GenBank database with the accession number KF188423. The EtEF2 protein sequence shared 99 \% homology with the eEF2 sequence of Toxoplasma gondii (GenBank XP_002367778.1). The GTPase activity domain and ADP-ribosylation domain were conserved signature sequences of the eEF2 gene family. The changes in the transcriptional and translational levels of EtEF2 were detected through quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analyses. The mRNA expression level of EtEF2 was 2.706 fold increases and the protein level of EtEF2 was increased 67.31 \% under diclazuril treatment. In addition, the localization of EtEF2 was investigated through immunofluorescence assay. Experimental results demonstrated that EtEF2 was distributed primarily in the cytoplasm of second-generation merozoites, and its fluorescence intensity was enhanced after diclazuril treatment. These findings indicated that EtEF2 may have an important role in understanding the signaling mechanism underlying the anticoccidial action of diclazuril and could be a promising target for novel drug exploration.},

 abstract = {Abstract Background The negative signal provided by some co-inhibitory factors such as programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) has been associated with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection induced-T cell exhaustion, although the correlation of CpG methylation of the Pdcd1 gene with PD-1 expression and medical laboratory indicators in CHB infection has not yet been elucidated. Methods Blood samples from 20 CHB infection patients and 20 spontaneous clearance (SC) patients were collected. Percentages of PD-1-positive CD8+ T cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. The percentage of CpG methylation at the Pdcd1 locus was analyzed by bisulfite sequencing. Student's t test, Pearson and Spearman's correlation, and Mann–Whitney tests were used in the statistical analysis. Results Percentages of PD-1-positive CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood T cells were significantly higher in CHB patients than in the SC group (p < 0.001). The methylation level of Pdcd1 was significantly lower in CHB patients (p < 0.001) and the methylation level of Pdcd1 was negatively correlated with PD-1 expression level in CD8+ T cells (p < 0.001) and hepatitis-B surface antigen (HBsAg) (p < 0.001). Conclusions The results of the present study suggest that Pdcd1 methylation is correlated with PD-1 expression on CD8+ T cells and correlated with HBsAg and alanine aminotransferase. The results may provide new ideas regarding anti-PD-1 inhibitors, and epigenetic regulators such as demethylation inhibitors could represent more successful therapeutic strategies in hepatitis B infection patients.},

This is only enhanced by recent successes in the field of classical machine learning. In this work we propose an approach for the systematic treatment of machine learning, from the perspective of quantum information. Our approach is general and covers all three main branches of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. While quantum improvements in supervised and unsupervised learning have been reported, reinforcement learning has received much less attention. Within our approach, we tackle the problem of quantum enhancements in reinforcement learning as well, and propose a systematic scheme for providing improvements. As an example, we show that quadratic improvements in learning efficiency, and exponential improvements in performance over limited time periods, can be obtained for a broad class of learning problems.},

 abstract = {Quantum neural network is a useful tool which has seen more development over the years mainly after twentieth century. Like artificial neural network (ANN), a novel, useful and applicable concept has been proposed recently which is known as quantum neural network (QNN). QNN has been developed combining the basics of ANN with quantum computation paradigm which is superior than the traditional ANN. QNN is being used in computer games, function approximation, handling big data etc. Algorithms of QNN are also used in modelling social networks, associative memory devices, and automated control systems etc. Different models of QNN has been proposed by different researchers throughout the world but systematic study of these models have not been done till date. Moreover, application of QNN may also be seen in some of the related research papers. As such, this paper includes different models which have been developed and further the implement of the same in various applications. In order to understand the powerfulness of QNN, few results and reasons are incorporated to show that these new models are more useful and efficient than traditional ANN.},

 abstract = {The self-organized map, an architecture suggested for artificial neural networks, is explained by presenting simulation experiments and practical applications. The self-organizing map has the property of effectively creating spatially organized internal representations of various features of input signals and their abstractions. One result of this is that the self-organization process can discover semantic relationships in sentences. Brain maps, semantic maps, and early work on competitive learning are reviewed. The self-organizing map algorithm (an algorithm which order responses spatially) is reviewed, focusing on best matching cell selection and adaptation of the weight vectors. Suggestions for applying the self-organizing map algorithm, demonstrations of the ordering process, and an example of hierarchical clustering of data are presented. Fine tuning the map by learning vector quantization is addressed. The use of self-organized maps in practical speech recognition and a simulation experiment on semantic mapping are discussed.<>},

These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech.},

 abstract = {Over the past decade, the search for dietary factors on which to base cancer prevention guidelines has led to the rapid expansion of the field of dietary patterns and cancer. Multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses have reported epidemiological associations between specific cancer types and both data-driven dietary patterns determined by empirical analyses and investigator-defined dietary indexes based on a predetermined set of dietary components. New developments, such as the use of metabolomics to identify objective biomarkers of dietary patterns and novel statistical techniques, could provide further insights into the links between diet and cancer risk. Although animal models of dietary patterns are limited, progress in this area could identify the potential mechanisms underlying the disease-specific associations observed in epidemiological studies. In this Review, we summarize the current state of the field, provide a critical appraisal of new developments and identify priority areas for future research. An underlying theme that emerges is that the effectiveness of different dietary pattern recommendations in reducing risk could depend on the type of cancer or on other risk factors such as family history, sex, age and other lifestyle factors or comorbidities as well as on metabolomic signatures or gut microbiota profiles.},

In this comprehensive study, epigenetic drugs are categorized according to anticancer mechanisms and phase of therapy. The relevant articles or databases were searched for epigenetic approaches to cancer therapy. Epigenetic drugs are divided according to their mechanisms and clinical phases that have been approved by the FDA or are undergoing evaluation phases. DNA methylation agents, chromatin remodelers specially HDACs, and noncoding RNAs especially microRNAs are the main epi-drugs for cancer. Despite many challenges, combination therapy using epi-drugs and routine therapies such as chemotherapy in various approaches have exhibited beneficial effects compared with each treatment alone. Cancer stem cell targeting and epigenetic editing have been confirmed as definitive pathways for cancer treatment. This paper reviewed the available epigenetic approaches to cancer therapy.},

However, a major bottleneck for agents to learn in real-life situations is the size and complexity of the corresponding task environment. Even in a moderately realistic environment, it may simply take too long to rationally respond to a given situation. If the environment is impatient, allowing only a certain time for a response, an agent may then be unable to cope with the situation and to learn at all. Here, we show that quantum physics can help and provide a quadratic speedup for active learning as a genuine problem of artificial intelligence. This result will be particularly relevant for applications involving complex task environments.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we will discuss a formal link between neural networks and quantum computing. For that purpose we will present a simple model for the description of the neural network by forming sub-graphs of the whole network with the same or a similar state. We will describe the interaction between these areas by closed loops, the feedback loops. The change of the graph is given by the deformations of the loops. This fact can be mathematically formalized by the fundamental group of the graph. Furthermore the neuron has two basic states |0〉 (ground state) and |1〉 (excited state). The whole state of an area of neurons is the linear combination of the two basic state with complex coefficients representing the signals (with 3 Parameters: amplitude, frequency and phase) along the neurons. If something changed in this area, we need a transformation which will preserve this general form of a state (mathematically, this transformation must be an element of the group S L(2; C)). The same argumentation must be true for the feedback loops, i.e. a general transformation of states along the feedback loops is an assignment of this loop to an element of the transformation group. Then it can be shown that the set of all signals forms a manifold (character variety) and all properties of the network must be encoded in this manifold. In the paper, we will discuss how to interpret learning and intuition in this model. Using the Morgan-Shalen compactification, the limit for signals with large amplitude can be analyzed by using quasi-Fuchsian groups as represented by dessins d’enfants (graphs to analyze Riemannian surfaces). As shown by Planat and collaborators, these dessins d’enfants are a direct bridge to (topological) quantum computing with permutation groups. The normalization of the signal reduces to the group S U(2) and the whole model to a quantum network. Then we have a direct connection to quantum circuits. This network can be transformed into operations on tensor networks. Formally we will obtain a link between machine learning and Quantum computing.},

We describe the network in terms of a quantum circuit, and then draw its equivalent classical neural net which involves O(k^n) nodes in the hidden layer. Then, we show that the network uses a periodic activation function of cosine values of the linear combinations of the inputs and weights. The backpropagation is described through the gradient descent, and then iris and breast cancer datasets are used for the simulations. The numerical results indicate the network can be used in machine learning problems and it may provide exponential speedup over the same structured classical neural net.},

@article{qml2,
 abstract = {We use a quantum annealing D-Wave 2X computer to obtain solutions to NP-hard sparse coding problems. To reduce the dimensionality of the sparse coding problem to fit on the quantum D-Wave 2X hardware, we passed downsampled MNIST images through a bottleneck autoencoder. To establish a benchmark for classification performance on this reduced dimensional data set, we used an AlexNet-like architecture implemented in TensorFlow, obtaining a classification score of 94.54±0.7\%. As a control, we showed that the same AlexNet-like architecture produced near-state-of-the-art classification performance (∼99\%) on the original MNIST images. To obtain a set of optimized features for inferring sparse representations of the reduced dimensional MNIST dataset, we imprinted on a random set of 47 image patches followed by an off-line unsupervised learning algorithm using stochastic gradient descent to optimize for sparse coding. Our single-layer of sparse coding matched the stride and patch size of the first convolutional layer of the AlexNet-like deep neural network and contained 47 fully-connected features, 47 being the maximum number of dictionary elements that could be embedded onto the D-Wave 2X hardware. Recent work suggests that the optimal level of sparsity corresponds to a critical value of the trade-off parameter associated with a putative second order phase transition, an observation supported by a free energy analysis of D-Wave energy states. When the sparse representations inferred by the D-Wave 2X were passed to a linear support vector machine, we obtained a classification score of 95.68\%. Thus, on this problem, we find that a single-layer of quantum inference is able to outperform a standard deep neural network architecture.},

Although the BOW and TF-IDF are simple and perform well in tasks like classification and clustering, its representation efficiency is extremely low. Besides, word level semantic similarity is not captured which results failing to capture text level similarity in many situations. In this paper, we propose a straightforward Bag Of Word cLusters (BOWL) representation for texts in a higher level, much lower dimensional space. We exploit the word embeddings to group semantically close words and consider them as a whole. The word embeddings are trained on a large corpus and incorporate extensive knowledge. We demonstrate on three benchmark datasets and two tasks, that BOWL representation shows significant advantages in terms of representation accuracy and efficiency.},

Although the Euclidean distance is one of the most widely used distance metrics in ML, it has not received much consideration in the development of these quantum variants. In this article, a novel quantum k-NN algorithm based on the Euclidean distance is introduced. Specifically, the algorithm is characterized by a quantum encoding requiring a low number of qubits and a simple quantum circuit not involving oracles, aspects that favor its realization. In addition to the mathematical formulation and some complexity observations, a detailed empirical evaluation with simulations is presented. In particular, the results have shown the correctness of the formulation, a drop in the performance of the algorithm when the number of measurements is limited, the competitiveness with respect to some classical baseline methods in the ideal case, and the possibility of improving the performance by increasing the number of measurements.},

We explored various classical-to-quantum mapping methods; ranging from basis encoding and angle encoding to amplitude encoding; for encoding classical data. We conducted an extensive empirical study encompassing popular ML algorithms, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, and ensemble methods like Random Forest, LightGBM, AdaBoost, and CatBoost. Our findings reveal that quantum data embedding contributes to improved classification accuracy and F1 scores, particularly notable in models that inherently benefit from enhanced feature representation. We observed nuanced effects on running time, with low-complexity models exhibiting moderate increases and more computationally intensive models experiencing discernible changes. Notably, ensemble methods demonstrated a favorable balance between performance gains and computational overhead. This study underscores the potential of quantum data embedding to enhance classical ML models and emphasizes the importance of weighing performance improvements against computational costs. Future research may involve refining quantum encoding processes to optimize computational efficiency and explore scalability for real-world applications. Our work contributes to the growing body of knowledge on the intersection of quantum computing and classical machine learning, offering insights for researchers and practitioners seeking to harness the advantages of quantum-inspired techniques in practical scenarios.},

However, in classical algorithms, the time used to similarity measurement usually increases exponentially as the amount of data and the number of data dimensions increase. In this paper, we presented three quantum algorithms based on Euclidean distance to measure the similarity between data sets. In the proposed algorithms, some special unitary operations are utilized to construct imperative quantum states from quantum random access memory. Then, a badly needed result for estimating the similarity between data sets, can be got by performing projective measurements. Furthermore, it is shown that these algorithms can achieve the exponential acceleration of the classical algorithm in the quantity or the dimension of data.},

	abstract = {Modern quantum machine learning (QML) methods involve variationally optimizing a parameterized quantum circuit on a training data set, and subsequently making predictions on a testing data set (i.e., generalizing). In this work, we provide a comprehensive study of generalization performance in QML after training on a limited number N of training data points. We show that the generalization error of a quantum machine learning model with T trainable gates scales at worst as \$\${\textbackslash}sqrt\{T/N\}\$\$. When only K ≪ T gates have undergone substantial change in the optimization process, we prove that the generalization error improves to \$\${\textbackslash}sqrt\{K/N\}\$\$. Our results imply that the compiling of unitaries into a polynomial number of native gates, a crucial application for the quantum computing industry that typically uses exponential-size training data, can be sped up significantly. We also show that classification of quantum states across a phase transition with a quantum convolutional neural network requires only a very small training data set. Other potential applications include learning quantum error correcting codes or quantum dynamical simulation. Our work injects new hope into the field of QML, as good generalization is guaranteed from few training data.},

	abstract = {One of the most important properties of classical neural networks is how surprisingly trainable they are, though their training algorithms typically rely on optimizing complicated, nonconvex loss functions. Previous results have shown that unlike the case in classical neural networks, variational quantum models are often not trainable. The most studied phenomenon is the onset of barren plateaus in the training landscape of these quantum models, typically when the models are very deep. This focus on barren plateaus has made the phenomenon almost synonymous with the trainability of quantum models. Here, we show that barren plateaus are only a part of the story. We prove that a wide class of variational quantum models—which are shallow, and exhibit no barren plateaus—have only a superpolynomially small fraction of local minima within any constant energy from the global minimum, rendering these models untrainable if no good initial guess of the optimal parameters is known. We also study the trainability of variational quantum algorithms from a statistical query framework, and show that noisy optimization of a wide variety of quantum models is impossible with a sub-exponential number of queries. Finally, we numerically confirm our results on a variety of problem instances. Though we exclude a wide variety of quantum algorithms here, we give reason for optimism for certain classes of variational algorithms and discuss potential ways forward in showing the practical utility of such algorithms.},

In this work we address this question by trying to understand how powerful and trainable quantum machine learning models are in relation to popular classical neural networks. We propose the effective dimension—a measure that captures these qualities—and prove that it can be used to assess any statistical model’s ability to generalize on new data. Crucially, the effective dimension is a data-dependent measure that depends on the Fisher information, which allows us to gauge the ability of a model to train. We demonstrate numerically that a class of quantum neural networks is able to achieve a considerably better effective dimension than comparable feedforward networks and train faster, suggesting an advantage for quantum machine learning, which we verify on real quantum hardware.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2408.13687},
	abstract = {Quantum error correction provides a path to reach practical quantum computing by combining multiple physical qubits into a logical qubit, where the logical error rate is suppressed exponentially as more qubits are added. However, this exponential suppression only occurs if the physical error rate is below a critical threshold. In this work, we present two surface code memories operating below this threshold: a distance-7 code and a distance-5 code integrated with a real-time decoder. The logical error rate of our larger quantum memory is suppressed by a factor of \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$ = 2.14 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.02 when increasing the code distance by two, culminating in a 101-qubit distance-7 code with 0.143\% \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.003\% error per cycle of error correction. This logical memory is also beyond break-even, exceeding its best physical qubit's lifetime by a factor of 2.4 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.3. We maintain below-threshold performance when decoding in real time, achieving an average decoder latency of 63 \${\textbackslash}mu\$s at distance-5 up to a million cycles, with a cycle time of 1.1 \${\textbackslash}mu\$s. To probe the limits of our error-correction performance, we run repetition codes up to distance-29 and find that logical performance is limited by rare correlated error events occurring approximately once every hour, or 3 \${\textbackslash}times\$ 10\${\textasciicircum}9\$ cycles. Our results present device performance that, if scaled, could realize the operational requirements of large scale fault-tolerant quantum algorithms.},

Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have recently gained much attention due to their ability to generate diverse and high-quality samples in many computer vision tasks, as well as to incorporate flexible model architectures and a relatively simple training scheme. Quantum generative models, empowered by entanglement and superposition, have brought new insight to learning classical and quantum data. Inspired by the classical counterpart, we propose the quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic model (QuDDPM) to enable efficiently trainable generative learning of quantum data. QuDDPM adopts sufficient layers of circuits to guarantee expressivity, while it introduces multiple intermediate training tasks as interpolation between the target distribution and noise to avoid barren plateau and guarantee efficient training. We provide bounds on the learning error and demonstrate QuDDPM’s capability in learning correlated quantum noise model, quantum many-body phases, and topological structure of quantum data. The results provide a paradigm for versatile and efficient quantum generative learning.},

This paper explores the integration of quantum machine learning and variational quantum circuits to augment the efficacy of diffusion-based image generation models. Specifically, we address two challenges of classical diffusion models: their low sampling speed and the extensive parameter requirements. We introduce two quantum diffusion models and benchmark their capabilities against their classical counterparts using MNIST digits, Fashion MNIST, and CIFAR-10. Our models surpass the classical models with similar parameter counts in terms of performance metrics FID, SSIM, and PSNR. Moreover, we introduce a consistency model unitary single sampling architecture that combines the diffusion procedure into a single step, enabling a fast one-step image generation.},

	abstract = {The astounding acceleration in Artificial Intelligence and Quantum Computing advances naturally gives rise to a line of research, which unrolls the potential advantages of quantum computing on classical Machine Learning tasks, known as Quantum Machine Learning or Quantum Machine Intelligence. The typical objectives are either (1) exploring the potential quantum advantages on classical learning tasks or (2) levering well-established classical ML algorithms to tackle quantum-related problems on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Along the second research direction, we study Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) to accomplish the purpose of Bayesian learning. By observing a wide range of studies on QNNs, in which the sole training method is based on frequentist training, we find that Bayesian learning benefits QNNs from two aspects. First, Bayesian-trained models enjoy a high level of generalization due to the prior and posterior distribution usage compared to frequentist training, which will be justified by this paper’s theoretical study of model capacity. Second, Bayesian Inference offers epistemic uncertainty estimation, which merits the decision-making process. It is worth mentioning that frequentist-trained QNNs generally lack this desirable property. Under the Bayesian training procedure, our derived models can be considered a new class of QNNs (called BayesianQNNs) which possesses both desirable properties of Bayesian Inference while maintaining comparable predictive performance as frequentist counterparts. The proposed Bayesian Quantum Neural Networks is justified by empirical evidence from numerical experiments.},

	abstract = {Binary embedding is a nonlinear dimension reduction methodology where high dimensional data are embedded into the Hamming cube while preserving the structure of the original space. Specifically, for an arbitrary N distinct points in {\textbackslash}mathbbS{\textasciicircum}p-1, our goal is to encode each point using m-dimensional binary strings such that we can reconstruct their geodesic distance up to δuniform distortion. Existing binary embedding algorithms either lack theoretical guarantees or suffer from running time O(mp). We make three contributions: (1) we establish a lower bound that shows any binary embedding oblivious to the set of points requires m =Ω({\textbackslash}frac1δ{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}logN) bits and a similar lower bound for non-oblivious embeddings into Hamming distance; (2) we propose a novel fast binary embedding algorithm with provably optimal bit complexity m = O({\textbackslash}frac1 δ{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}logN) and near linear running time O(p {\textbackslash}log p) whenever {\textbackslash}log N ≪δ{\textbackslash}sqrtp, with a slightly worse running time for larger {\textbackslash}log N; (3) we also provide an analytic result about embedding a general set of points K ⊆{\textbackslash}mathbbS{\textasciicircum}p-1 with even infinite size. Our theoretical findings are supported through experiments on both synthetic and real data sets.},
