## [Unreleased]

## Marek and Ilia corrections v0.0.4
### Added
- Summary of quantum Hamming distance calculation `review.ipnb`	 
- Made a more broad statement about our algorithm potential so that paper does not end suddenly.

### Changed
- Figure `qcircuit`: add stages, removed measurements and initialization.
- Quantum circuit explanation
- Figure `distance_matrix`: single figure with marked errors. Simulators was removed.
- Figure `sofm_fitting`: changed markers from dots to triangles and enlarged them.
- Measurement result explanation
- Explanation of error of distance matrix calculation
- SOFM algorithm explanation
- Review of the complexity and comparison with previous realization.
